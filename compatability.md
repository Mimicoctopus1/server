# Compatability
Version number help:
In a version number, the 2nd number goes up when a change is made. The 1st number goes up when a change is made that makes it incompatable with the previous version. The 3rd number goes up when there is a bug fix. The 4th number goes up when something ridiculously small is changed. Usually, the game is compatable with all versions with the same first and second numbers. When a number is changed, all the numbers after it go to zero. Some software developers choose to leave out the fourth number.
